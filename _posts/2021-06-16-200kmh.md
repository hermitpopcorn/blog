No matter how fast the train goes, you can still sit down and read peacefully. The scenery outside the windows come and go in a flash, yet barely anything seems to move inside the cars.

That's me right now. Reading comic books and sleeping early despite the mountain of tasks that I have to finish. "There's still time," I reassure myself every single moment of my waking life.

I'm walking at a very slow pace towards the front car. I'm fully aware that this train is going to crash at a wall and it's going to be very painful when it happens. Even so, me being me, I'll only be pulling the brakes at the very, very last moment.
