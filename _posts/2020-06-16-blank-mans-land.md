It's been two (or three?) months since the lockdown started, and people are already going outside. Those who aren't are spending their time productively at home. Me? I do nothing but games, since I have no hobbies. Really sad...

But then I remembered that I am (was?) also a programmer. I suddenly took it upon myself to spend my stay-at-home time building a game.

It was always my dream of building a mystery visual-novel style point-and-click game. Kinda like Danganronpa, but without any of the 3D stuff (as I'm pretty sure that's beyond my abilities). Thus, I tried creating a basic event sequence and message display system, and then the click system, yada yada.

[I've experimented with the engine and found that it's pretty much doable.](https://hermitpopcorn.github.io/godot-test/).

But now comes the hard part. Actually, I have no idea what my game is about. What the story is, what will the player do... I just couldn't think up of anything.

This reminds me of the fact that I'm not a conceptor, but just an executor. A cog in the machine of somebody's design. Intellectual property is more expensive than human labor because not everyone can think.

I wish I have the capacity to generate ideas instead of just realizing them. Well, probably only geniuses can create a game from scratch to finish by their own lonesome anyway. Which is a roundabout way of saying that I wish I had friends I can build this game with. Pretty sure no one in my immediate group of friends share my interest, though.
