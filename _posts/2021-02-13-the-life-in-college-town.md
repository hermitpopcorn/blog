title: "(en) the life in college town"
---

Jatinangor is a college town, with (at least?) three universities in it, with Padjadjaran University being the biggest one of the bunch. It's actually a not part of Bandung, but Sumedang. I haven't explored Sumedang myself, but I'm pretty sure Jatinangor is strikingly more high-end compared to the rest of the regency because of all the gentrification.

Staying there is my first experience living away from my parents. The freedom was fun. I get to stay outside and go home at any hour I wish, no parents warning me to get home because they want to lock the doors and all that thing. The minus was the creeping loneliness. I tend to do stupid shit at night because I had nothing to do and no one to talk with.

But no, I was rarely ever lonely. Almost everyday, I stay on campus until very close to (sometimes even past) midnight with my friends. The best part of that college town is the freedom... and the friends. I'm sure that freedom comes by default, so I'm really glad I enrolled in 2017 and got them as my friends.

Now here I am, writing this from Nagoya. It's not a college town, but I get to have the same amount of freedom. Well... mostly. The friends I make here are good people too, I have fun with them a lot. But... stuyding abroad for one year means I'll be held back a year at Padjadjaran University, and my friends will all graduate before I even come back. When I go back home and come back to that supposed fun college town living, they won't be there anymore. It's not gonna be fun anymore. I cried a little when I first thought about it.

Makes me think that college town isn't about the place, but the people. The people you're with.
