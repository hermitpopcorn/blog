title: "(en) ZERO DRIVE"

Lately all I do is sleep, play games, and read.

I... just don't have the drive to do anything anymore. Be it school, work, or even relationships. I do realize this isn't a good thing, but I couldn't even give myself enough shit to do something about it.

Is this toxic levels of nihilism? I'm not a nihilist (nor do I actually know what being a nihilist means), it's just that I've always thought that life is meaningless, but the interactions, the things you do with other humans is what makes it worthwhile. Though, now I seem to think that life is worth living when you spend time *not* living in it, evident from me excessively spending my time in the world of dreams, games, and comic books as of late.

Even *writing this very post!* I don't like writing. It's something I do when I don't feel like doing anything else. I was compelled to write this post because my heart wants me to do anything remotely productive, even though I know that writing in my blog is far from it; writing blog posts just gives the illusion that it's a productive thing to do. It accomplishes nothing.

It's hard for me to admit, but I'm just a useless human trash now. I've said it numerous times before, but that's just because saying it makes me seem modest and being modest is what's cool and hip. All those times, deep down I know that I'm actually good for something. Yet this time, I have to say it for real. I **literally** (wrong usage of literally btw) haven't been doing anything I can deem productive.

You know what useless people should do?

But I don't want to do that. This month's free PS Plus game, Nioh, is pretty awesome.
