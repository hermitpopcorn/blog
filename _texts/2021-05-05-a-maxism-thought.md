![Picture of my feet on beach sand.](/blog/assets/img/beach-foot.jpg)

I like the beach. Feeling the sea breeze on my skin is nice. Today I went to Tokoname Rinkuu Beach because I just wanted to go to the beach. I thought no one would be there, because who goes to a beach in Spring? Turns out I was wrong and the place was full of people. I wanted to flop around in the sand but I chickened out because I was afraid people would look at me weird.

I spent quite a time sitting on the sand and thinking about a lot of stuff. One of the things that flew into my mind was Spore, a 2008 simulation-strategy game from the developer Maxis. Why would I even think about this game, you ask? It's because the game starts off in the depths of the sea. To put the gameplay simply: you raise a sentient, intelligent race from it's birth: as a small microscopic organism in the sea. You then then help it evolve limbs and move on to land, form civilization, then finally shoot for the stars and colonize other stars and planets. The sea is the beginning, the genesis of all races. Probably ours too.

Really, it's just some sort of god-simulation game where you raise an intelligent life. I don't know enough science to confidently tell you whether we actually started as tiny blobs in the sea, but what comes after in that game, the course of the final stages in that game *really* stuck with me, all these years. See, in Phase 4, you try to unite all different nations in the planet through various means of diplomacy, and when every nation is united as one, you go into the final Phase 5 and play in the galactic stage.

When I played that game back in middle school, it formed my opinion of what mankind's final destiny is: to conquer the stars and reach the center of the galaxy. Some people think humans exist only to seek salvation, or to worship a god until He decides to end all life. Maybe we are. But I don't think humans as a collective will think that's enough for us. I think our greedy nature dictates that we'll want to expand, forever. And that means if everything goes right for us, humans will stand as the apex predator, the strongest civilization not only on Earth, but the entire Milky Way galaxy. And then Andromeda too. And then the entire cluster. And then the entire universe.

What a grand dream, isn't it? Not like I can help with any of it, I'm just a humanities major. But well, enough about space and back to the game. What I want to say is, it's crazy how a game shaped my views on humankind. I'm pretty sure Maxis didn't make that game to be a propaganda in order to turn little kids into hungry space warmongers, they probably just designed the later stages of the game to be fun while following what scientists have said about the progression of human race. Like according to the Kardashev scale or something like that. Still, it stuck with me. It *cemented* in me what we as a race have to strive for, what the endgame is for us.

If I ever make a creative work--be it a game, story, whatever--I want it not only to impress, but also *inspire*. Leave something in the hearts of people for years to come.

P.S. what the hell is this post? It isn't coherent at all. At least it makes for a tough reading comprehension test, I guess...
